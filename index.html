<h1>About Me: </h1> 
<p>My name is Beatriz Reyes Martinez but my friends call me Bee. I am 23 years old, a senior at<br>
Sacramento State. My major is <strong>Computer Science  with a minor in Mathematics</strong>. <br>
I am from Hillsboro, Oregon. A small town that is 20 mins away fromPortland. We moved to California <br>
when I was about 5 years old. Once receiving my bachelors in computer science, I hope to get a job<br>
in front-end programming since I like to design websites. Somethings I like to do in my free time is<br>
going on hikes, painting, and going to the beach. Overall, I like to be outdoors and always up to try <br>
new things!<br>
